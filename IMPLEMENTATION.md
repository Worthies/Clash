- Color-coded log levels
- Timestamps
- Clear logs functionality
- Auto-limit to 1000 entries
- Icon indicators for each level

#### 7. Test Page (lib/pages/test_page.dart)
Speed testing with:
- Batch proxy testing
- Progress indicator during testing
- Test results with latency
- Success/failure status
- Color-coded delay indicators
- Sequential testing of all proxies

#### 8. Settings Page (lib/pages/settings_page.dart)
Configuration options:
- System proxy toggle
- Allow LAN toggle
- Mixed port configuration
- About section (version, framework, license)
- Port edit dialog
- License page integration

### Widgets

#### Traffic Monitor (lib/widgets/traffic_monitor.dart)
Reusable component showing:
- Upload traffic with icon
- Download traffic with icon
- Total traffic with icon
- Auto-formatted byte values
- Color-coded indicators (blue/green/orange)
- Responsive layout

### Tests (test/widget_test.dart)
Comprehensive unit tests for:
- TrafficStats byte formatting
- ClashState initialization
- Proxy mode changes
- Profile add/remove
- Connection add/clear
- Log add/clear
- Settings updates

## Technical Features

### State Management
- Provider pattern for reactive UI updates
- Centralized state in ClashState
- NotifyListeners for automatic UI refresh
- Immutable data models

### UI/UX
- Material Design 3 guidelines
- Responsive layouts
- Bottom navigation for 8 pages
- Card-based information display
- Color-coded status indicators
- Icon-based visual language
- Light and dark theme support
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Code Quality
- Linting with flutter_lints
- Const constructors where possible
- Organized file structure
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive documentation
